1.seems like the first file is already ordered？
2.if we take minute as interval there gonna be too many graphs？how to achieve timestamp？
3.I noticed that some lines do not have durations，means 0？
4.for part 3 we need to draw graph based on bytes sent and bytes received, draw their pdf and CDF in one graph？
